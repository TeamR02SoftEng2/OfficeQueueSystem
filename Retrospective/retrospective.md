> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube only for the selected and planned issues
  - Hours spent on remediation
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability")
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability )

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
